    "passage": "What makes us yawn? Yawning is something that we \ncannot control. Even in the mother's womb, eleven-week-old \nbabies have been observed to yawn. But why do we do it?\nOne popular explanation for yawning is that a person may be \ntired or bored. Although many believe this to be true, it cannot \nexplain why athletes yawn before an event or why dogs yawn \nbefore an attack. It is said that yawning is caused by a lack of oxygen and \nexcess carbon dioxide. A good example of this is when we yawn \nin groups. We yawn because we are competing for air. Others even believe that we yawn to cool our brains off. \nCool brains allow us to think more clearly so yawning is said to \nhelp us become more alert.",

    "passage": "I heard my happy little daughter sing a happy tune to what she was watching on TV. A smile gave her the puffy cheeks and sparkling eyes as she focused her attention on it. \"Mother! Do you like lambs?\" Jasmine asked me. I put down my phone and glasses, then glanced at her. \"Of course. They are fluffy and adorable. Who wouldn't?\" I replied. \"But why bad men cut their fur?\" she asked.\n\"No, my child. Sheep or adult lamb's fur is used to make clothes. Don't worry, their fur usually grows back. But Mr. Edward isn't a bad man, okay?\" I explained and reasoned with her. Though she was hesitant, she agreed. A soft, endearing aura filled the cream walls of the room. The resounding of the fans spinning along with Jasmine's noticeable breathing, was very calming. She finally took her first move and spun around gleefully. She danced and sang along to the song of the birds and the stupendous rhythm of the trees as they swayed against their will. She twirled and would make expressive poses as the song went on.\nI sat back down at our table and took the newspaper. I opened the gray, folded paper and read through the headlines. \"This is really boring.\" I flipped another one, \"How did these students convert noise to electricity? If my old classmates were to use this, we would have infinite electricity.\"\n\"To see is to believe. Is that true, Mother?\" Jasmine sweetly asked. \"I believe so. Seeing something means it is true, so believe in it. Do you understand?\" I asked her, and she nodded.\n\"My dear, let me tell you something. A word and advice.\" I pat her back and she only responded with a small \"sure\". She sat down on the maroon sofa with intricate tiny flower designs. I took a seat on the opposite to the sofa she was sitting on. \"Many are sacrificing just to give other people a better life. Let us appreciate them.\"\nJasmine blinked, before clasping her hands together. \"What do you mean?\" she asked.\n\"For example, sheep give us comfortable sweaters. Scientists invent and discover things for the development of our society. In battles, there are people who are brave enough to fight for their country. Just like your father. He was a brave man.\" I ruffled her hair.\nShe smiled adoringly. \"I understand, Mother. One day, I'll help you out, too!\" she exclaimed and hugged me. \"As you wish, my dear,\" I replied.",

    "passage": "As the brilliant red and orange light in the sky faded, the Owl's hooting echoed through the forest. She was now ready to hunt. When the soft glowing light appeared in the sky, the Owl began her sweet slumber while other animals in the forest started their daily activities.\nOne sunny day, the Owl dozed in the hollow of an old tree. The three blind mice passed by and joyfully sang. The Owl was annoyed and shouted at the three mice. \"Stay away from here foolish mice, you have no respect,\" she angrily said. Disheartened, the mice stopped singing and went away.\nLittle Rabbit, who lived nearby, took out his drum that his parents gave him for his birthday. He was excited to try it. He went out from his hole and started beating his drum in perfect rhythm, while he stomped his feet. This awakened and irritated the Owl. The Owl threw a twig at Little Rabbit and said, \"Hey, stay away from here, disgusting rabbit, you have no respect,\" she uttered. Saddened by the scolding of the Owl, Little Rabbit went away.\nThe five little monkeys were preparing for their sports competition in school. They had to strengthen their muscles. They swung in the trees and happily screeched, gibbered and whooped. They reached the old tree where the Owl was sleeping. Enraged with the noise, the Owl went out from her hole and stared angrily at the monkeys. She said, \"Stay away from here, you are all annoying and inconsiderate\". The five little monkeys were hurt by the Owl's words so, they went away.\nThe same thing happened to every animal that passed by the old tree where the Owl slept. She drove everyone away and hurled them with nasty and harsh words.\nNight time came. All animals in the forest went home to rest and sleep. On the other hand, the Owl woke up to start her hunting activity. As he flew around the forest, her \"Hooooh hooooh!\" resonated in the quiet forest. All animals woke up and went out of their homes.\n\"You're disgusting, you have no respect,\" the three blind mice exclaimed.\n\"You are foolish, you have no respect,\" the rabbit added.\n\"You are inconsiderate, you have no respect,\" the five monkeys shouted.\nOther animals joined in cursing the Owl. \"Stay away from here, nasty Owl! Stay away from this forest,\" they yelled.\nThose offensively impolite words from the animals made her spirit low. She felt sad and guilty. She flew away and never came back to that forest anymore.",

    "passage": "Ming, the cat, gave birth to three adorable furry kittens. The first one was pure white with blue eyes, the second was orange with some gray stripes with yellow eyes, and the third looked exactly as its mother, all black with emerald eyes. She placed them inside the shoebox in the linen room. Doggie the dog came near her and sniffed her kittens. \"I am warning you Doggie. Never touch my children or else you will be in trouble,\" she uttered. Doggie went away, his tail curved between his legs.\nThe night was dark and quiet. Ming prowled through the attic and waited for any mouse to come out. She was yearning for a fresh prey to regain her strength which she lost in giving birth to her kittens. Suddenly, she heard a squeak. A big mouse came out from its hole. She ran after it and grabbed its tail. It struggled to free itself from the cat's paw, but to no avail.\n\"Please, don't eat me. My children are waiting for my safe return. They are still too small and couldn't manage to live without a mother,\" the mouse begged. Ming's heart was touched by the mouse's words. She remembered her children and empathized with the mouse. She unclenched her claws and the mouse ran away.\nShe stayed there the whole night, but no more mouse came out. Dawn came with the crowing of the roosters. She smelled something from the kitchen. Her masters were preparing breakfast and she knew that her regular supply of milk would be ready, too. She licked the milk in the bowl until there was no more left. She decided to go back to her kittens. \"They might be hungry,\" she said. \"I need to breastfeed them.\"\nShe hurried her steps, but when she looked at the box, it was empty. \"My kittens are missing, my kittens are missing!\" she let out an angry cry. She angrily looked at Doggie who was still sleeping on some rugs, his body curled. Ming stiffened her rear legs and moved toward the dog. She growled and scratched the poor dog on its face. Startled, Doggie woke up in pain and gave a deafening bark. This fueled the cat's anger. She clawed and bit him. \"Stop! Stop!\" said the confused dog. \"I won't stop unless you show me my kittens!,\" the cat shouted. \"But I...\" the dog interrupted. He did not finish what he was going to say when Ming stopped. The purring of tiny kittens was heard.\nMing left the wounded dog and followed the sound. She peered through the slightly opened door and saw her master's children cuddling her kittens. She meowed! \"Oh, hello Ming, looking for your kittens? Here they are, we just borrowed them for a while!\" exclaimed one of the children.",

    "passage": "There was a time in the history of Lu Shing Empire that dragons lived in harmony with humans. These winged, four-legged animals were capable of breathing fire and hoarding gold, which they shared with the people. Everyone felt secured and enjoyed a prosperous life.\nDrago, a dragon with pinkish-red skin and light green scales served the emperor and his family. He was especially dear to the emperor\u2019s daughter, Celestine, who enjoyed riding on Drago\u2019s back as he flew her to magical lands.\n\u201cOh, Drago! I love you! We\u2019ve been to many places, yet you haven\u2019t taken me to the place where other dragons hid the treasures. Can you take me there, please?\u201d pleaded Celestine.\n\u201cBut, it\u2019s forbidden,\u201d Drago replied.\n\u201cPlease Drago, I am just curious. Promise! I won\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d Celestine insisted. Drago could not resist the Princess\u2019 charm, so he agreed.\nA soldier overheard their conversation and reported it back to the emperor. \u201cIf I could have all those treasures, this empire would be the most powerful in the world. Everyone would worship me like a god!\u201d the greedy emperor exclaimed. He ordered his soldier to follow Drago and his daughter.\nIn no time, Drago and Celestine reached a big cave on top of the Seventh Mountain. Celestine\u2019s eyes widened and her jaws dropped when she saw a gigantic heap of gold. The hoard-guarding dragon was lying on top of gold and was soundly sleeping.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go, Celestine. I would be in so much trouble if any of my kind finds out that I took you here,\u201d Drago nervously said.\nThey were about to leave when the emperor, armed with a battalion of soldiers, arrived. They aimed their spears at the sleeping dragon. Before it could even wake, hundreds of spears and arrows landed on its body that brought to its instant death. Enraged with what he witnessed, Drago exhaled a flaming fire toward the emperor and the soldiers\u2019 direction.\n\u201cDrago, please stop. He is my father and they are my people,\u201d pleaded the princess with tears streaming down her face. Drago bent his knees on the ground as a sign of retreat when a dagger hit his right eye.\nIt came from the emperor. Bleeding in pain, Drago still managed to release a fiery breath which burned the emperor to death. The remaining soldiers finished him off with a rain of arrows that killed the poor Drago.\nThe tragic event caused the other dragons to leave Shu Ling empire. From then on dragons were never seen again. Celestine buried Drago\u2019s remains in the palace garden. She would visit her friend every day to ease her guilt. After some weeks, a peculiar plant similar to a cactus, sprouted where Drago\u2019s body was buried. It bore fruit with pinkish-red skin and light green scales reminiscent of Drago\u2019s feature. Celestine picked one of its fruits and tasted it. It was sweet! Sweet like her friend, Drago.\nFrom then on, it was believed that the plant was Drago. It was called \u201cdrago fruit\u201d which later on became dragon fruit.",

Little Octopus, who was an eager learner, wanted to sit in front, but the nasty Goldfish drove her away. \"Stay away from us, weirdo,\" Goldfish uttered. Everyone laughed and joined in discriminating the poor octopus. \"Look at her bulbous head, it looks funny!\" added the mean Seahorse. \"Hey, how does it feel to have those arms? Are you not confused where is left and right?\" the Clam taunted her. But Little Octopus was reminded of her mother's word that she should not pick any fight in school and be friendly. She did not say a word and just sat in the last row where no one was seated near her.\nTeacher Stick Fish went on with her class when an emergency bell rang. The principal, Sea Turtle, immediately swam around the school campus. \"The shark is coming! Proceed to the emergency hideout now!\" he announced. But it was too late. The ravenous shark was already in front of them and there was no way to escape. Its big mouth opened, ready to pierce everyone with its sharp teeth and swallow them in an instant. The nasty and mean Goldfish, Seahorse and along with other sea animals in the school screamed and were terrified of their expected death. Suddenly, Little Octopus bravely appeared in front of them and squirted a cloud of dark ink which deterred the extremely hungry shark. Confused, the shark went away.\n\"Thank you for saving all of us,\" Mr. Sea Turtle said. \"You are indeed our hero, dear,\" Teacher Stick Fish added. The rest gathered around the Little Octopus and shook her arms. Her classmates, Gold Fish, Oyster and Seahorse went near her and expressed their regret of being rude at her. \"We're so sorry. We misjudged you. Thank you for saving our lives!\" they exclaimed.",

    "passage": "Once, there was a poor young boy named Emmanuel. The young boy always loved going to church, together with his mom. Since they were poor, he could not have the things he needed and eat the foods he wanted. Emmanuel had always dreamt of living a comfortable life. Every time he went to church, he prayed to be successful so he could buy all the things he wanted and needed.\nGrowing up, Emmanuel studied hard and graduated with honors. After graduating from college, he was immediately hired as a manager. Emmanuel never forgot to give thanks to the Lord for slowly granting all his wishes and prayers. Despite his position in the company, he was working on, he still worked very hard until he finally had a company of his own. He was very successful and became one of the richest people in the country. He lived the life he always dreamt of when he was still a poor young boy, but forgot the one who made the success possible for him. He had everything, yet he did not even bother to give thanks to God.\nA few months later, Emmanuel's business slowly failed. He got depressed and started blaming the Almighty Father for all the bad things that happened to his life. It was not long when he realized that it was because he forgot the Lord.\nOne day, with hands clasped together, he entered the church with his faith slowly getting back to its stability. Tears started falling on his face. He stopped walking. In front of the altar, he kneeled. While crying deeply, he heard God's voice saying, \"Go back to me, everything is temporary.\"\nOn that day, Emmanuel resubmitted himself to the Lord. He realized that he was nothing without the grace of God.",

    "passage": "Reddy found a new owner after being displayed in the Show Room for a month. Reddy was a sleek brand new red car. She was the coolest car in town, for she had some features that other cars in the neighborhood did not have-a remote control to start-up, high end stereos, parking cameras, anti-collision warning system, and cool head-up displays. He looked around and thought that other cars were shabby. While he entered the subdivision, everyone greeted him. \"Hey, buddy! Welcome!\" honked an old model black car, Black Oldie. \"You are the coolest car I've seen. Welcome!\" admired Bumblebee, the yellow car. \"Oh, welcome fella,\" greeted Silvery, the silver car who puffed a gray cloud of smoke. But, Reddy did not reply. \"I don't want to be friends with those ugly and shabby cars,\" he told himself.\nWhile other cars were friends with each other, Reddy remained solitary. He was confident that he was self-sufficient. His stereos gave him entertainment and his handsome appearance made him feel so confident.\nEvery day, he would run screeching in high speed while his stereos played to its maximum. Other cars were nervous about Reddy's recklessness and speeding. But they knew that Reddy would not take any advice from them. \"One day, he will learn his lesson the hard way,\" Black Oldie muttered.\nOne night, Reddy went home drunk. He wobbled on the road and almost hit Bumblebee. \"Reddy, are you okay? Please drive slowly!\" uttered the concerned yellow car. But Reddy brushed him off. The overly-confident car yelled, \"You scruffy car, don't tell me what to do. I am far more high-tech than you!\"\nReddy continued to wobble and ran at 160 miles per hour. His anti-collision warning system flashed a red light on his dash board, but he did not notice. He felt dizzy and the vision of the road was blurry to him. He lost control and he whirled horribly, then hit the post. His sleek and shiny body was dilapidated, overly torn and unrecognizable.\nOther cars in the neighborhood came and gathered around him. They pitied Reddy for his tragic fate. \"Poor Reddy! If only he listened,\" Bumblebee said. \"This is what happened when you are too proud of yourself,\" muttered Silvery. \"Indeed, he learned his lesson the hard way,\" Oldie Black sighed.",

    "passage": "Archie lay down on his bed with his cell phone held both by his hands. His thumbs briskly and continuously touched the screen as the rainbow-colored lights flickered on his face. His eyes, wide open, almost popped out. He was playing the most popular mobile game, the Mobile Legends.\n\u201cAn ally has been slain! All troops deployed,\u201d his cell phone sounded. \u201cYehey! I won! I won!\u201d he gladly uttered. It seemed to win in a game was Archie\u2019s greatest achievement. It was his daily routine after school to lock himself in his room and play until midnight or sometimes until early morning.\nThe next day, he would be late in school and showed less interest in his lessons. While his teachers discussed, Archie sat quietly on the chair and stared blankly at the chalkboard. The teacher thought he was listening, but his mind was preoccupied with grunts, gun fires and shouts of heroes in his game.\nDuring recess and lunch breaks, he took out his phone and played instead of feeding himself with nutritious food. He would eat a little and hurriedly went back to playing. He also cut classes just to be home and play his favorite Mobile Legends.\nHis mother was called by his class adviser on many occasions regarding Archie\u2019s worrisome habits in school and about his failing grades, but she didn\u2019t know how to stop Archie from playing with his phone.\nOne day, she picked a hard argument with her son that turned into Archie\u2019s angry outburst. It was past midnight when she peered at her son\u2019s bedroom. Archie was still awake. He was still playing.\n\u201cArchie, turn that off and go to sleep!\u201d she demanded. \u201cI need to finish this mom,\u201d Archie insisted.\n\u201cNo! Give that cell phone to me,\u201d she angrily said. But Archie didn\u2019t obey his mother. He slammed the door, locked it and shouted something from the inside.\nStunned, her mother cried. \u201cWhat happened to my son?\u201d she muttered. Archie\u2019s father worked abroad and only came home every two years for a two-month vacation. He didn\u2019t know about his son\u2019s addiction to Mobile Legends because his wife did not tell him for it would be of no help and would only cause her husband to worry too much.\nShe kneeled down and prayed, \u201cGod, what shall I do with my son? Please help me,\u201d she sobbed.\nArchie fell asleep; his cell phone was in his hand still turned on and logged in to Mobile Legends. The cell phone vibrated and gave off a blinding bright light. All the characters in Mobile Legends went out one by one and started fighting with each other. Archie woke up surprised and ran out from his room, but some of the assassins followed him. They were determined to kill him. \u201cMother, help me! Help me!\u201d he trembled in fear.\n\u201cArchie, wake up. You are dreaming,\u201d she said. Archie slowly opened his eyes and hugged his mother. \u201cI am not dreaming mother, they\u2019re real. They are here to kill me,\u201d Archie was nervous and his body was shaking.\nHer mother gently touched his face then said, \u201cOh darling, you have a high fever. I will bring you to the hospital.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to die, mom. Please help me,\u201d he whispered. Archie was diagnosed by the doctor with gaming addiction, which is a compulsive mental health disorder that could cause severe damage to one\u2019s life. His physical and mental health declined due to skipped meals, stress and insufficient sleep and rest. The doctor advised his mother how to help Archie go back to his old self.\nThe process would be difficult and long, but Archie\u2019s mother was determined to help her poor boy.",

    "passage": "It was a normal morning for everybody in town. The children played in the backyard and the adults enjoyed a warm plate of breakfast. Despite the good weather and happy children, one child chose to stay inside the house. She sat on her bed and stared at a pile of papers in front of her\u2014all of them marked failed. She began to weep. All of a sudden, she stood up and picked the papers. Enraged, she ripped every piece of paper, one by one.  \n\u201cThis is horrible! My parents shouldn\u2019t know about my poor performance in school!\u201d She continued to sob and threw the pieces of paper in the trash bin.  \n\u201cMarian, it\u2019s time for breakfast! Please get out of your room and eat,\u201d a voice called to her.  \n\u201cBut Mother, I wish to study,\u201d Marian insisted.  \n\u201cNo buts. Just take your breakfast, honey,\u201d her mother replied. Marian pouted, but she had no choice but to obey her mother.  \n\u201cGood morning, Marian,\u201d Mr. Andrada, Marian\u2019s father, greeted her.  \n\u201cI hope you are doing well, my dear.\u201d  \nMrs. Andrada placed three plates of pancake on the table.  \n\u201cI am, Mother,\u201d Marian replied.  \n\u201cHow is school, dear?\u201d her father asked. She froze in fear.  \n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Marian? Is there anything wrong?\u201d her concerned mother pat the table softly, while looking at Marian with caring eyes.  \n\u201cIs this my punishment for slacking off? I shouldn\u2019t have played with other kids too much,\u201d she thought to herself.  \n\u201cMarian Andrada. Is there something wrong?\u201d Her father slammed his hands on the table, which frightened Marian.  \n\u201cDarling, let her think,\u201d her mother caressed her father\u2019s coarse hands.  \nMarian gathered courage to tell the truth to her parents.  \n\u201cMother, Father\u2026,\u201d she paused. \u201cI failed in our quarterly exam.\u201d She forced herself to admit. The words finally escaped her mouth, guilt rushing over her as her parents\u2019 eyes widened.  \n\u201cUum, I\u2019m sorry, for I have disappointed you,\u201d Marian pled. The poor young lady expected the worst. Her parents had been very strict with her lately. Surely there is a consequence.  \n\u201cYoung lady, this is disappointing to hear.\u201d She was right, but something unexpected happened.  \n\u201cBut we understand. You were always in your room, studying your lessons. Of course, you won\u2019t have time to meet people. That worried us a lot. So when you asked to play with your friends, I was glad. Glad that you are willing to engage with the others,\u201d her father explained.  \n\u201cI am so lucky to be your daughter.\u201d Marian beamed.  \n\u201cWe love you dear!\u201d Her father exclaimed.  \n\u201cNo matter what happens, we will love you from the bottom of our heart. Remember that,\u201d her mother assured her. She hugged her parents as tight as she could.  \nNow, Marian has more reason to study and do better in school.",

    "passage": "There was once a young boy who was the son of a poor farmer. He helped his father till a small parcel of land they were renting. But drought came and dried all their crops.  \n\u201cIt\u2019s hopeless! This drought will continue for months. We cannot wait that long or else we will die from hunger!\u201d the father exclaimed.  \n\u201cWhy not sell our goat and use the money from it in starting a business? That goat has no use to our farm anymore,\u201d his mother interrupted.  \n\u201cThat\u2019s a nice idea mother!\u201d the boy said. \u201cWe can buy a sack of salt from Aling Thelma and sell it at retail in the nearby town.\u201d  \nAnd so the frail, poor goat was sold and the young boy\u2019s family bought a sack of salt in the hope that they can have a new source of income until the drought was over.  \nThe young boy, together with his father, went to the nearby town to start their luck on new-found business. \u201cSalt for sale! Salt for sale! Only ten pesos per pack,\u201d shouted the young boy while they trudged the rough road.  \nFrom afar, the boy saw kids of his age joyfully running after one another. They were happy and clothed in neat and presentable clothes. He looked at his shirt. It was sweaty and dirty.  \n\u201cPapa, if we sell this sack of salt, can I buy new clothes for myself?\u201d he asked. \u201cOf course son, you can buy new clothes if you work hard,\u201d his father replied.  \nThey continued walking until they reached a busy street. They finally reached their destination and started calling out customers. But nobody came to buy.  \nThey ate lunch\u2014just rice and a dash of salt. The boy asked again, \u201cPapa, if we sell all the salt in this sack, can I have a meal in that restaurant?\u201d  \n\u201cOf course dear, you can dine in that restaurant if you work hard,\u201d his father said.  \nDetermined, the boy carried ten packs of salt and went around the town calling out customers.  \nBut then, it started to drizzle. People ran for shelter. The boy slipped after bumping into an old man. The salt packs scattered and dissolved in the rain.  \nDevastated but kind, the boy helped the old man get up. \u201cDon\u2019t worry sir, I still have a chance tomorrow.\u201d  \n\u201cPlease keep this pouch, young boy! Put in here all the money you earn from selling salt,\u201d the old man said.  \nThe day ended with no sale. But when the boy returned and shouted again the next day, coins magically filled the pouch\u2014one for every call.  \n\u201cIt\u2019s a magic pouch!\u201d he exclaimed.",

    "passage": "I started for school very late that morning and was in great dread of a scolding, especially because M. Hamel \nhad said that he would question us on principles, and I did not know the first word about them. For a moment \nI thought of running away and spending the day out of doors. It was so warm, so bright! The birds were chirping at \nthe edge of the woods; and in the open field back of the sawmill the Prussian soldiers were drilling. It was all \nmuch more tempting than the rule for participles, but I had the strength to resist, and hurried off to school.\nWhen I passed the town hall there was a crowd in front of the bulletinboard. For the last two years all our bad news \nhad come from there-the lost battles, the draft, the orders of the commanding officer- and I thought to myself, without \nstopping: \"What can be the matter now?\" Then, as I hurried by as fast as I could go, the blacksmith, Watcher, who was \nthere, with his apprentice, reading the bulletin, called after me: \"Don't go so fast, bub; you'll get to your school \nin plenty of time!\" I thought he was making me fun of me, and reached M. Hamel's little garden all out of breath.\nUsually, when the school began, there was a great bustle, which could be heard out in the street the opening and closing \nof desks, lessons repeated in unison, very loud, with our hands over our ears to understand better, and the teacher's \ngreat ruler rapping on the table. But now it was all so still! I had counted on the commotion to get to my desk without being\nseen; but, of course, that day everything had to be as quiet as Sunday morning. Through the window I saw my classmates \nalready in their places, and M. Hamel walking up and down with his terrible iron ruler under his arm. I had to open \nthe door and go in before everybody. You can imagine how I blushed and how frightened I was. But nothing happened. \nM Hamel saw me and said very kindly: \"Go to your place quickly, little Franz. We were beginning without you.\" I jumped \nover the bench and sat down at my desk. Not till then, when I hadgotten a little over my fright, did I see that our teacher \nhad on his tone which beautiful green coat, his frilled shirt, and the little black silk cap, all embroidered, that \nhe never wore except on inspection and prize days. Besides the whole school seemed so strange and solemn. But the \nthing that surprised me most was to see on the black benches that were alway empty, the village people setting quietly like \nourselves; old Hauser,with his three-cornered hat, the former mayor, the former postmaster and several others besides. \nEverybody looked sad; and Hauser had brought an old primer, thumbed at the edge, and he held open on his knees with his \ngreat spectacles lying across the ages. While I was wondering about it all, M. Hamel mounted his chair and in the same grave \nand gentle tone which he had used to me said: \"My children, this is the last lesson I shall give you. The order has come from \nBerlin to teach only German in the school of Alsace and Lorraine. The new master comes to-morrow. This is your last \nFrench lesson. I want you to be very attentive.\" What a thunderclap these words were to me! Oh, the wretches; that was what \nthey had put up at the town-hall! My last French lesson! Why, I hardly knew how to write! I should never learn anymore! \nI must stop there, then! Oh, how sorry I was for not learning my lessons, for seeking birds' eggs, or going sliding on \nthe Saar! My books, that had seemed such a nuisance a while ago, so heavy to carry, my grammar and my history of the \nsaints, were old friends now that I couldn't give up. And M. Hamel, too; the idea that he was going away, that I should \nnever see him again, made me forget all about his ruler and how cranky he was. Poor man! It was in honor of this last \nlesson that he had put of this last lesson that he had put on his fine Sunday clothes, and now I understood why the \nold men of the village were sitting there in the back of the room. It was because they were sorry, too, that they had \nnot gone to school more. It was their way of thanking our master for his forty years of faithful service and of showing \ntheir respect for the country that was theirs no more. While I was thinking of all this, I heard my name called. It was \nturn to recite. What would I not have given to be able to say that dreadful for the participle all through, very loud \nand clear, and without one mistake? But I got mixed up on the first words and stood there, holding on to my desk, my \nheart beating, and not daring to look up.",

A few weeks later, Christopher passed through the school cafeteria while the Boy Scouts were having one of \ntheir meetings. The boys were sitting in small groups, talking excitedly and referring to their manuals. \"Probably \ndiscussing some new Boy-Scout rule,\" thought Christopher, but he slowed down as he was passing one of the tables. \nHe heard one of the Scouts say, \"We'll need cables, too, and helmets.

    "passage": "At the heart of Barangay Quirino, Solano, Nueva Vizcaya, in a place popularly known as \"Diamond\" lived the family of \nMang Ricardo and Aling Maring with their children Christine, Catherine, and Christian. The family came from the town \nof Ramon, Isabela, and migrated to Solano in the year 2014 after their place had been damaged by a strong typhoon. \nThey lived in an old stock room which Mang Ricardo just repaired. Mang Ricardo earned a living by doing simple car \nrepairs while his wife accepted laundry work from neighbors and friends.\nOne morning, Christine asked her mother if she may continue her studies in their new place. Aling Maring \nlooked seriously at her and quietly entered the house. Aling Maring went inside the room and opened a small \nshoe box with some coins in it. Day by day, after receiving her pay for the laundry work, she drops few coins \nin the box. She wanted to enroll her children the coming school year.\nChristine went to the next house to watch television. At the screen, Christine saw the most popular fast food store \nin town. Many people, young and old, visit the store everyday because of the delicious food being served and the \nattractive cartoon characters as well as the well-equipped play area in the store. It has been Christine's dream \nto reach the well-known fast food store in town, eat inside, have picture-taking with the giant mascots and enjoy \nin the play area; although she knew this will remain a dream for her parents could not really afford to bring her there.\nThe next morning, Aling Maring brought her three children to school and enrolled them. Aling Maring was so thankful \nthat she was able to earn enough money to buy her children's school needs. Christine met new friends since she was a \nvery friendly and helpful girl. Day by day, her teacher observed how responsible she was. She always stayed behind \ncleaning and fixing the chairs. She also performed excellently in different subjects.\nMonths passed by and her teacher had proven so many times how kind-hearted and trustworthy Christine was, \nthat's why she had light feelings towards the girl. One afternoon, in their English class, the teacher told \nher pupils to write a short paragraph expressing their wishes this holiday season.\nShe was so touched by what Christine wrote that went this way:\nEvery child longs to receive expensive gifts and visit malls this holiday season but mine is a very simple one. I \nlove to visit the well-known fast food store in town but I understand that father and mother could not bring me \nthere because of financial problem. I wish a kind-hearted person could bring me there this special holiday. I will \nbe happier if my brother and sister can come with me. I wish we could taste the delicious foods served in that store \nand have picture-taking with the giant mascots. If this wish will be granted, it will definitely spell out holiday for \nme, the BEST ONE, with Christian, and Catherine.\nThe teacher paused for a while and said, \"This is a very nice girl. How can I make her happy?\"\nDecember 19, the day scheduled for a class program, the teacher handed a letter to Christine. Christine \ncould not believe what is written in the letter. Her teacher will be picking her up on December 24 with her \nsiblings, Christian, and Catherine. Christine asked her teacher why she will be picking them up on the said \ndate but she did not get an answer. Her teacher just looked at her and smiled meaningfully.\nThe three children woke up so early in that morning. They were excited to know the teacher's surprise. \nThey immediately met their teacher upon seeing her. They excitedly rode in a tricycle.\nThey stopped in front of a big stall. Christine's eyes twinkled. She couldn't believe \nthey were in front of the store she was dreaming before. The teacher told them to get inside \nand choose the foods they want. Christine could not believe she is now inside the fast food \nstore. While they were eating, they enjoyed watching the giant mascots displayed in the \nstore. Christine was so overwhelmed with joy.\n\"Happy Holiday to all of you. I hope you liked my simple gift,\" the teacher said. She also handed each of them with \na pair of new clothes. Christine remembered what she had written on her paper few weeks ago. \"Thank you so much Ma'am. \nYou made us so happy today. This is the best holiday we ever had,\" she said joyfully.\nShe closed her eyes and prayed. \"Thank you Holy Creator for bringing us wonderful people this special holiday,\" she \nsaid with a great smile.",
